<p>The 4Câ€™s of Cloud Native security are</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cloud</li>
  <li>Clusters</li>
  <li>Containers</li>
  <li>Code</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/images/4c.png" alt="K8s Security" title="K8s Security" /></p>

<p>Each layer of the Cloud Native security model builds upon the next outermost layer. The Code layer benefits from strong base (Cloud, Cluster, Container) security layers. You cannot safeguard against poor security standards in the base layers by addressing security at the Code level.</p>

<h2 id="cloud">Cloud</h2>
<p>In many ways, the Cloud (or co-located servers, or the corporate datacenter) is the trusted computing base of a Kubernetes cluster. If the Cloud layer is vulnerable (or configured in a vulnerable way) then there is no guarantee that the components built on top of this base are secure. Each cloud provider makes security recommendations for running workloads securely in their environment.</p>

<h2 id="cluster">Cluster</h2>
<p>There are two areas of concern for securing Kubernetes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Components OF the Cluster</li>
  <li>Components IN the cluster</li>
</ul>
